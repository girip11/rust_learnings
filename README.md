# Rust_learnings

Documenting my rust learnings. Rust is a systems programming language

> Systems programming is resource-constrained programming. It is programming when every byte and every CPU cycle counts.
> However, you don't just need to learn Rust. To get the most out of the language, you also need to gain some experience with systems programming. We recommend reading this book while also implementing some systems programming side projects in Rust. Build something you’ve never built before, something that takes advantage of Rust’s speed, concurrency, and safety. The list of topics at the beginning of this preface should give you some ideas.
